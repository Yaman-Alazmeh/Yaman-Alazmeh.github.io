title: "Network Security Project"
---


This project demonstrates my understanding of practical cybersecurity through building a complete penetration-testing environment using Kali Linux and Metasploitable 2.
I created an isolated virtual lab where I performed vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and analysis in a controlled,
ethical setting. Using tools such as Nmap and the Metasploit Framework, I scanned the target machine, identified outdated services,
and exploited real security weaknesses like the vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor. 
After gaining remote shell access, I analyzed the system, reviewed user accounts and directories, and observed how insecure configurations can be abused by attackers. 
The goal of the project was not only to execute successful exploits but also to understand the underlying risks and propose security improvements such as patching vulnerable services, 
limiting open ports, and strengthening network configurations. 
This hands-on experience gave me a strong foundation in ethical hacking, system hardening, and real-world network security practices.

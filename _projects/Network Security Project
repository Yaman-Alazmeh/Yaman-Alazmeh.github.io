This project is a practical cybersecurity assignment where I built a full penetration-testing environment using Kali Linux,
Metasploitable 2, and VMware. The goal was to understand how attackers find and exploit vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled lab.


Penetration Testing & Vulnerability Exploitation

This project focuses on practical cybersecurity, where I learned how attackers find and exploit weaknesses in computer systems.
I created a full virtual lab using VMware, with Kali Linux as the attacker machine and Metasploitable 2 as the vulnerable target.



This project gave me hands-on experience with:

Ethical hacking

Vulnerability scanning

Exploitation using Metasploit

Secure system configuration

Understanding how attackers think and operate

title: "Soho Shopping Website"
---

Soho is an e-commerce shopping website developed as part of my Web Programming 1 course.
The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin, focusing on both functionality and visual design.
The website features a clean, classy shopping interface with multiple product categories, allowing users to browse items easily.
It includes a fully functional shopping cart system, dynamic product display, user interactions through JavaScript, and backend integration using PHP and MySQL.

This project demonstrates my ability to build a complete full-stack web application, covering both front-end UI and back-end database operations.

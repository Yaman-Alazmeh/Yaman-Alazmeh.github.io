Faculty of Information Technology & Engineering (ITE) 3D Building Simulation

using OpenGL and C++ 

This project is a full 3D interactive simulation of my university’s Faculty of Information Technology & Engineering (ITE), built entirely using OpenGL and C++. It was created as part of a university computer graphics course and represents a virtual reconstruction of the real building, complete with interior details and interactive elements.

Key Features

Full 3D Model of the ITE Building
Includes classrooms, lecture halls, hallways, offices, cafeteria (canteen), rest areas, and student facilities.

Interactive Classrooms,

Classroom doors can open and close,

Chairs have movable arms that can be raised/lowered,

Realistic Interior Facilities,

Teachers’ offices,

Deans’ offices,

Employees’ administrative offices,

Cafeteria with tables and seating,

Recycle bins and fire extinguishers placed in realistic locations,

Hallway desks and seating areas,

Student storage cabinets for bags.


Lighting System:
Users can turn lights on/off, affecting the atmosphere and realism of the scene.

Free Navigation:
The user can roam freely inside the building to explore different rooms and facilities.


The goal of the project was to apply computer graphics concepts such as transformations, lighting, camera control, and object modeling while creating a meaningful and realistic representation of the actual faculty building.

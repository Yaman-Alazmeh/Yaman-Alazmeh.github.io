This research project explores how machine learning and audio signal processing can be used to support new parents by identifying the reasons behind a baby’s cry and providing helpful,
personalized recommendations. The system combines multiple components—audio feature extraction, classification logic, evaluation metrics,
and a simple user interface—to create an early prototype of an AI-powered baby assistant.

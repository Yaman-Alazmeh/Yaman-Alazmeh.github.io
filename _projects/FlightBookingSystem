This project is a complete client–server flight booking system built entirely in Java using:

Java Sockets & Multi-threading for client–server communication

Swing GUI for user interaction

Text-file storage for users, flights, and booking history

Object-oriented design



Project Overview

The system simulates a real airline reservation environment.
It uses a server that manages all flights, users, authentication, discounts, and file updates, while the client provides a GUI where users and admins can access the system.



Key Features


1. User Authentication

Sign In, Sign Up, and Admin Login

Credentials stored in local file storage (Passengers.txt)

Secure validation through socket communication

2. Booking Flights

Users can book flights in two ways:

Using Passport

Using Visa

The system loads available destinations from:

Passport_counters.txt

visa_counters.txt

Then it shows:

Matching countries

Available flights

Flight details (ID, date, cost, class, time)

3. Discount System

A unique discount mechanism:

Users receive discounts based on their previous flights

The server checks each customer’s file:
username_previous_flights.txt

If user took:

3 or more High-class flights → 50% discount

3 or more Business-class flights → 30% discount

Ticket price updated dynamically on the server

4. File-Based Storage System

All data is stored in structured text files:

Flights.txt (All available flights)

Passengers.txt (Users & balances)

*_previous_flights.txt (History for each user)

The server includes custom functions to:

Modify a specific line in a file

Remove lines

Rewrite files with updated values

5. Balance & Payment Handling

Server checks user’s balance before booking

Updates the file with the new balance

Saves the booked flight to the user’s history file

6. Admin Panel

When signed in as admin, the system allows:

Adding flights

Updating flights

Removing flights

Admin operations modify the flight list in Flights.txt.

7. Multi-threaded Server

The server uses threads to handle multiple client connections

Runs continuously on port 7000

8. Swing GUI

All user interactions use pop-ups:

Input dialogs

Multi-choice
